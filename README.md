# Odd-Even-Split-Mix-A-Hybrid-Cipher
This hybrid cipher encrypts messages in two stages: it splits the plaintext into odd and even-positioned letters. Odd letters are encrypted using the Playfair cipher, while even letters are reversed and encrypted using Caesar substitution. The final ciphertext combines both encrypted parts.
